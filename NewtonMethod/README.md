Fluid Dynamics
============
Final project for Fluid Dynamics (Spring 2016) implementing 1D Euler's Equation (Navier-Stokes)

NewtonMethod
============

- Java implementation of Newton's Method for approximating roots of real-valued functions.
- Two example usages included in Main.java:
  - approximating a root of a polynomial function
  - approximating a root of a product of polynomials
  - printing formulae the given functions
  - taking the derivative of the given functions
